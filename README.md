# StreetFight
simple multiplayer side scroller fighting built in python.
I develoiped the game during my final year of highschool as a class project where I wanted to explore how to utilize controller inputs
This game was made to learn and utilize the pygame library and specifically reading inputs from an external controller.

To play this game open StreetFighter.py and run using python. ensure that you have at least 1 controller plugged into any USB port of the computer
The game will prompt you to select a map by scrolling with D-Pad inputs, followed by the A button to select the map. 
once the game begins, players fight by depleteing others healthbars health bars until one player is standing
 
This game can be played with as many players as controllers aree plugged in, although the all players besides player 1 will be located on the right side of the screen and have matching clothes. During development i did not have time to limit player count or customize starting positions. 

Additions and changes to look for in the future:
- player limit (likely 4)
- platforms and variable maps
- character selection
